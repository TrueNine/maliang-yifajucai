# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical test failures in the backend test suite, specifically focusing on Redis serialization issues and related cascade problems. The current test suite has 6 failing tests out of 163 total tests, with a 96% success rate that needs to be improved to 100%. The main issues are related to Jackson JSON serialization/deserialization problems when working with Redis, particularly with the `@class` type information handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Redis serialization tests to pass, so that the caching and session management functionality works correctly in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ApiCallRecordServiceTest runs THEN the `post_to_cache_and_scheduled_save_writes_records_to_db()` test SHALL pass without SerializationException
2. WHEN AuthServiceTest runs THEN the `user_disable_and_enable_operations_work_correctly()` test SHALL pass without Redis serialization errors
3. WHEN AuthServiceTest runs THEN the `user_login_state_management_works_correctly()` test SHALL pass without Redis serialization errors
4. WHEN AuthServiceTest runs THEN the `user_logout_clears_session_correctly()` test SHALL pass without Redis serialization errors
5. WHEN SessionServiceTest runs THEN the `test_datetime_serialization_to_redis()` test SHALL pass without serialization errors
6. WHEN SessionServiceTest runs THEN the `user_logout_clears_session_correctly()` test SHALL pass without serialization errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Redis serialization configuration across all test environments, so that tests behave predictably and match production behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis serialization is configured THEN it SHALL handle `@class` type information correctly for polymorphic types
2. WHEN Redis serialization is configured THEN it SHALL support all entity types used in the application (ApiCallRecordDraft, SessionData, etc.)
3. WHEN Redis serialization is configured THEN it SHALL be consistent between test and production environments
4. WHEN Redis serialization is configured THEN it SHALL handle datetime objects correctly
5. WHEN Redis serialization is configured THEN it SHALL handle Kotlin data classes and builders correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test configurations to be properly isolated and not interfere with each other, so that tests can run reliably in any order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN each test SHALL have proper setup and teardown to avoid state leakage
2. WHEN tests run THEN Redis cache SHALL be properly cleared between tests
3. WHEN tests run THEN database state SHALL be properly managed with rollback annotations
4. WHEN tests run THEN mock objects SHALL be properly configured and reset between tests
5. WHEN tests run THEN test containers SHALL be properly managed and reused efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage validation, so that I can ensure all critical functionality is properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve 100% test pass rate
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages for any failures
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL validate all Redis-related functionality
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL validate all session management functionality
